# Explore Network Sniffing and ARP Attacks

# AIM:

To explore network sniffing and ARP Attacks

## STEPS:

- `Step 1:` Install kali linux either in partition or virtual box or in live mode
- `Step 2:` Investigate on the various categories of tools as follows.
-  `Step 3:` Open terminal and try execute some kali linux commands

## ARP Attacks:  
ARP spoofing: A hacker sends fake ARP packets that link an attacker's MAC address with an IP of a computer already on the LAN. 
Boot kali and Windows7 virtual machines.
In windows 7 give the command arp -a
## OUTPUT:
